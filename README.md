# Computational-Model-for-Breast-Cancer-Recurrence-Risk-Prediction
Project under Shubrakanta Panda 

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a prediction model to identify the recurrence risk in breast cancer patients, thereby aiding in preventing medication errors resulting from over or undertreatment. Current clinical methods use clinicopathologic factors such as age, receptor expression, and tumor size. However, models based on genomics are often expensive, invasive, and time-consuming. By leveraging a dataset comprising over 70,000 tissue images of metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer patients, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of recurrence risk prediction.

## Introduction
Breast cancer recurrence prediction is crucial for determining appropriate treatment plans for patients. Traditional methods based on clinicopathologic factors are widely used but may lack the precision of genomics-based models. However, the latter are often prohibitive due to their cost, invasiveness, and time requirements. This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze a large dataset of tissue images, with the goal of predicting recurrence risk accurately and efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of over 70,000 tissue images from metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer patients. Each image is labeled to indicate whether it corresponds to metastatic or non-metastatic tissue.
Number of images: 70,000+
Labels: Metastatic, Non-metastatic

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch
